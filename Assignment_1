# Question 1

psuedocode
set num_1, num_2
multiplication of num_1 & num_2
print multiplication sum

num_1 <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)
num_2 <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)
  print("original vectors:')
  print(num_1)
  print(num_2)
  print("product of two vectors:')
  sum = num_1 * num_2
  print (sum)
  
# Question 2
Psuedocode
ask for number
read if 5 or 6
let you know if the number is a five or six

num_in <- readline(promt= "enter a number:")

if(isfive = 5)
if(issix = 6)
  num_out <- readline(prompt = "your number is a five or six:")
  
  else num_out <- readline(prompt = "your number is not a five or six:")
  
  
# Question 3
Pseudocode
write to enter a number
0>x>10 then blue
11>x>20 then red
21>x>30 then green
x>30 then no answer

num_in <- readline(prompt = "please enter a number:")

num_1 <- seq(0, 10, by = 1)
num_2 <- seq(11, 20, by = 1)
num_3 <- seq(21, 30, by = 1)

if(num_1) <- readline(prompt = "blue:")
if(num_2) <- readline(prompt = "red:")
if(num_3) <- readline(prompt = "green:")

# Question 4
Psuedocode
set starting point
set n
set by multiples of 5

x_values <- seq(0, 1000000000, by = 5)








# Question 5
Psuedocode
ask you to type in a number
use multiples of 2 to get to user number

int x, count, even; 
cout<<"0";
x = 1;
cin>>count; while(x < count)
        {  cout<<x*2;
  x = x + 1;
} 





#Question 6
psuedocode
ask user to enter 5 numbers
find minimum
finid min
find max
print to use the gathered info

num_in <- readline(prompt = "please enter five numbers:") 
x_values <- c(1,3,4,6,7)
mean(x_values)
min(x_values)
max(x_values)
  print("the average is (mean(x_values)")
  print("the average is (min(x_values)")
  print("the average is (max(x_values)")
